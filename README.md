This chess game is hopefully somewhat intuitive. 
The source code can all be found in /src

To play the game, just run chess.jar
Suggestions:
- The AI isn't fully developed and very slow still. I would suggest playing yourself if you can't find others.
- A size 8 board is pretty standard.
- To use the host/client feature, the clients will need the IP address of the host.
